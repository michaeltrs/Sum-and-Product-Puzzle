# Sum-and-Product-Puzzle
X and Y are two different whole numbers greater than 1. Their sum is no greater 
than 100, and Y is greater than X. S and P are two mathematicians (and 
consequently perfect logicians); S knows the sum X + Y and P knows the 
product X * Y. Both S and P know all the information in this paragraph.

The following conversation occurs:<br />
S : "P does not know X and Y."<br />
P : "Now I know X and Y."<br />
S : "Now I also know X and Y."<br />

What are X and Y?
